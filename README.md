## How It Works

The daily planner is arranged with rows and columns that the provide the user with a number of options to chose from. In the main body of the planner, the hour corresponding to the current time is displayed.  As the time changes, the hour rows change colors to keep the user aware of their current tasks for that hour, the past tasks that have already happened in that day, and what is to come until end of the work day.

The user can interact with the planner by adding in tasks at the needed time, then clicking the save button on the right side of the screen.  By doing this, the users tasks get saved into local storage where they will stay until the user deletes the task.

The functionality of the planner is based around the usage of Moment JS that is used to not only indicate the hour of the day, but to also set the date in the header of the page. Below is a visual representation of the daily planner. During the hours of 9 AM - 5 PM, the calendar displays red for the current hour and green for anytime in the future. For this example, the blocks are grey to show that the work has ended.
